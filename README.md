# InsideDonationsBot

Bot for posting alerts from DonationAlerts to telegram channel
 
This bot may seem ugly as it was written by at least three people. (It was found on github.)

We removed Flask, web server and threading from it, all the files were combined into one, bot uses of the telebot instead an aiogram.

Now the bot is functioning in @in51d3 telegram channel. 

Note that I am using python 3.8. 

To understand what is going on you need to read my comments in the code.
